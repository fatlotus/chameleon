## Chameleon

This project is a proof of concept, demonstrating the capability to make one
TCP stream look like another. Once finalized, Chameleon will likely live inside
one of the Tor pluggable transports, enabling protection against particular
types of HTTP timing side channels.

As a research prototype, this code is public domain.
